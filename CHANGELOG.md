# Changelog

**Document:** `CHANGELOG.md`
**Status:** Active — records only what has actually been established

All notable changes to the Revit-Extension (RCC BOQ) will be documented in this file.

The extension is early-stage with one pushbutton, so this changelog intentionally records only what
has actually been established — commits in git and, where applicable, what the XLSX harness verifies.

The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Because there is no
released software version yet, entries are keyed to the commits and to labelled milestones rather
than to pseudo-semver numbers.

**Verification vocabulary** used in this file:
- **Tested** — verified by `python test_xlsx_writer.py` (engine) when labelled `(harness)`.
- **Unverified** — present in code but not run in a live Revit session by an agent; the project
  owner confirms in-Revit behavior on a real project.

Nothing below claims a live Revit feature was verified by an agent when only the harness ran.

## Established so far

### `98fb30b` — Quantity takeoff and BOQ Summary sheet

**Quantity takeoff engine added.** `convert_quantity_value` converts Revit internal units to metric,
preferring `UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits` with `UnitTypeId`, falling back to
`DisplayUnitType`, then to deterministic foot-based constants. `get_element_quantities` appends
`Qty: Volume (m3)`, `Qty: Area (m2)`, `Qty: Length (m)` columns after the selected parameters so they
never disturb the parameter completeness audit.

**BOQ Summary sheet added.** The export inserts a `BOQ Summary` sheet — one row per populated
category plus a `GRAND TOTAL` — whose values are live cross-sheet `SUM()` formulas referencing the
element sheets. Empty categories do not produce a sheet. The workbook sets `fullCalcOnLoad`.

**Tested (harness).** `test_xlsx_writer.py` asserts sheet order, presence of `SUM(` formulas on the
Beam sheet, a BOQ Summary that references `Beam!` by formula, a `GRAND TOTAL` row, the auto-filter
range excluding the totals row, and the dark-blue header fill style.

### 0ab717c — Parameter metadata and Missing Values summary

**Parameter metadata capture added.** Per-parameter facts (storage type, built-in status, definition
info, data type, group, GUID) are collected into a metadata structure for the element sheets.

**Missing-values audit added.** `build_missing_values_summary` reports, per selected parameter that
has at least one empty value, the category, total elements, missing count, filled count, and fill
percentage. Completely-empty columns are pruned from the element sheets but still reported.

**Costing sheet introduced.** `build_costing_sheet` — per element row, Category, Element ID,
Quantity, Rate, and an Amount formula `Qty*Rate`, with a `SUM` `TOTAL` row. Rates are not hard-coded;
they come from whichever selected parameter name is recognized as a rate/price column.

**Note.** The metadata and missing-values functions exist and are exercised by the harness, while the
finalized workbook drops formerly-empty/tab duplicates; the harness explicitly checks that
`Parameter Metadata` and `Missing Values Summary` are **not** emitted as blank tabs.

### f14903b — BOQ pushbutton icon

**Icon added.** `icon.png` added to `BOQ.pushbutton` so the Generate panel button has a real icon.

### `09dab85` — RCC BOQ Parameter Manager UI

**Initial tool added.** `Aasif.extension/Aasif.tab/Generate.panel/BOQ.pushbutton` with `script.py`
and `ui.xaml`. Introduced the four-category dialog (Beam, Column, Slab, Foundation), per-category
parameter discovery from real elements, search + Add/Remove selection, WPF `ui.xaml` layout, status
bar, and the first dependency-free Open XML XLSX writer with element sheets and a `SaveFileDialog`.

**Tested (harness).** The XLSX engine functions are extracted from the real `script.py` and a sample
workbook is validated end-to-end.

## Open / unverified items

- In-Revit behavior of the dialog (parameter discovery, filters, selection, export scope, settings
  persistence, output path) — **Unverified by agent**; requires a live Revit 2025+ project on
  CP3123 and/or IP27 to certify, and is the project owner's confirmation step.
- `convert_quantity_value` numeric accuracy on actual Revit material units — the harness uses fixed
  sample data; real-model confirmation is pending.
- Dual-engine parity (CPython 3.12.3 vs IronPython 2.7) has not been executed by an agent.

Any of the above moving to "Tested" must be recorded here in the same change that establishes it.
