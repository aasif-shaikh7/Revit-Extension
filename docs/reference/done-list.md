# Kestrel — Done List

**Document:** `done-list.md`  
**Status:** Active — the record of work that is finished, and what finished means for each item  
**Companion to:** `todo-list.md`, which holds everything not yet finished  

---

## How to read this

`todo-list.md` is the queue. This is the receipt.

An item moves here when it reaches the phase `done` — which means **confirmed on the reference
device by the project owner**, not "written and it compiles". Until then it stays in the queue at
`pending`, `building` or `testing`.

Each entry says four things, in this order:

1. **What was asked for**, in the words it was asked in where they exist.
2. **What was actually built** — enough that somebody reading it a year later knows what to look for
   in the code.
3. **How it is known to work** — Measured, Reported, Reasoned or Unverified, the same vocabulary
   `todo-list.md` uses.
4. **What it cost**, where it cost something: a limit, an assumption, a thing deliberately not done.

**Nothing is written here on the strength of a build succeeding.** A compiler proves that the code
is well-formed. It proves nothing about a phone.

**Reference device for every "Measured" claim:** Redmi Note 13 5G, HyperOS 3.0.3, Android 15,
Shizuku shell (uid 2000), no root. One device, one firmware, one person testing.

## Closed items

### `CRIT-10` — 50%–150%, guaranteed to 115%, ceiling at 120% — **closed `0.0.39-dev`**

**Asked for.** *"create new default at 100% which can scale 50% and 150% respectively at default."*

**Built.** A default layout re-authored from the project owner's own arrangement — every size at
0.90 of what it was, every offset at 0.88 — sized so face buttons are 6.3 mm across at 100%.

**How it is known.** **Measured**, reference device: *"from 50% to 115% is good."*

**Cost, and it is the whole point of the entry.** The promise is 50%–115%, not 50%–150%. Guaranteeing
150% would need face buttons about 5 mm across at 100%, which is not worth shipping to reach a
number:

| face button at 100% | clean up to |
| --- | --- |
| 7.0 mm | 1.00 |
| **6.3 mm** | **1.15** |
| 5.6 mm | 1.25 |
| 4.9 mm | 1.45 |

The ceiling came down from 150% to **120%** in `0.0.39-dev`, so the band that is allowed but not
guaranteed is five points wide rather than thirty-five. Above 115% the editor marks what meets.

**One thing found on the way.** `BuiltInLayoutsTest` was validating the *landscape* arrangement on
portrait surfaces, which since `FEAT-15` is not what a portrait screen draws — a portrait
arrangement could have overlapped itself and passed. The search that produced this default was wrong
until the pairing was fixed. There is now a test that checks the portrait arrangement on portrait
screens.

---

### `BUG-44` — Typed numbers obey the limits dragging obeys — **closed `0.0.39-dev`**

**Reported.** `0.0.37-dev`: the dialog accepted sizes and offsets that dragging refuses.

**Built.** The numbers dialog checks the same bounds the drag does — size between 0.05 and 0.50 of
the shorter side, offsets within `Placement.MAX_OFFSET`, and the resolved control on the screen —
and says which one was missed. **Measured**, reference device: *"working"*.

**Cost.** None. It removed a second, invisible rule.

---

### `BUG-45` — Fading is a warning again — **closed `0.0.39-dev`**

**Reported.** *"if i set both to 5s then it would hide it without ever going halftone."*

**Built.** Hiding is counted **from the fade**, not from the last touch, so equal intervals give a
fade and then a hide instead of both at once. **Measured**, reference device: *"yes working"*.

**Cost.** None.

---

### `FEAT-49`, `FEAT-51`, `FEAT-52`, `FEAT-53`, `FEAT-54` — the editor's furniture — **closed `0.0.39-dev`**

**Built.** The anchor region is lit rather than dotted, and snaps to the same grid the dividers do.
Editor sizes stop at 0.05 and 0.50. The idle settings are four, and the toggle has its own. The
button block minimises to one draggable button instead of fading — *"a faded block is still there to
be caught by a thumb"* — and is opaque.

**How it is known.** **Measured**, reference device: *"working"*, *"yes done"*.

**Cost.** Minimising the block also took four useful status lines with the paragraph it was removing.
They came back in `FEAT-57` the following build. Solving the crowding by deleting the content was the
wrong cut, and it took a round to find out.

---

### `BUG-9` — A square drew as a rectangle in the editor — **closed `0.0.26-dev`**

**Reported.** `width 0.24`, `height 0.12`, shape `square`: a rectangle in the editor, a correct
square once saved and running.

**Built.** The rule — *a square is sized by the shorter of its two sides, a circle by its inscribed
radius* — existed in two places and the two disagreed. It is now one function in the domain,
`PixelRect.shapedAs(shape)`, with `LayoutElement.effectiveShape()` beside it for the related rule
that a stick and a pad are round whatever the document says. The overlay's private copy was deleted
and it calls these; the editor's preview and its hit-testing call them too, so a control is
*selected* by the same outline it is *drawn* with.

**How it is known.** **Measured** on the reference device — the project owner set those exact
numbers and the editor drew a square. Unit tests cover both rules.

**Cost.** None. This removed code.

---

### `FEAT-10` — The window editor — **closed `0.0.26-dev`**

**Asked for.** *"Whatever the case i also want the controller window editor also. on same screen as
layout editor with one toggle to greyout the buttons editor to window editor."*

**Built.** A **Controls / Windows** toggle at the top of the tool panel. The tools of the inactive
mode are **greyed out rather than hidden**, so it stays visible that the other mode exists. In
Windows mode the canvas draws each window as a translucent box around its group, the selected
control's window highlighted, and any window past a quarter of the screen drawn in orange; the panel
lists every window with its share of the screen as a percentage. `◀` and `▶` step a control through
*own window*, every group that exists, and a fresh `group-N` — chosen rather than typed, because
group names follow the same rules as element ids.

**Why it needed a screen at all.** A window is the enclosing rectangle of everything sharing a
group. A finger can slide between controls that share one — that is what makes rolling across face
buttons work, and what lets a thumb hold `L3` and then move the stick — but **every pixel of that
rectangle that is not a control is dead**. A touch there is refused, and, measured on the reference
device, a refused touch is *not* passed to the application underneath. Two grouped controls in
opposite corners make one screen-covering window and the game stops receiving touches. It was
editable only by hand and there was no way to see it.

**How it is known.** **Measured** — the project owner ran tests 9, 10 and 11: greying out, changing
a control's window, and the screen-covering warning all behaved. The platform behaviour underneath
is measured and recorded in `Clustering.kt`.

**Cost.** The editor does not stop a user making a window that covers the screen; it shows the
percentage and turns it orange. `ADR-007`'s spirit: say what is true, do not overrule the person.

---

### `BUG-11` — `Edit layout` reachable in portrait — **closed `0.0.27-dev`**

Three buttons in one non-wrapping row put the third off the edge in portrait, with nothing to scroll
sideways: the editor could not be opened with the phone upright. Split into two rows, `Edit layout`
first. **Measured** — the project owner confirmed it on the device.

**What it did not fix, and cost a round to learn:** the same fault existed in the editor's own tool
row, where `⋮ values` was the seventh button in a panel a quarter of a landscape screen wide. One
non-wrapping row was fixed and the next was left standing. `BUG-16` wraps them properly.

---

### `BUG-12` — Turning the phone keeps you in the editor — **closed `0.0.27-dev`**

`MainActivity` declares `configChanges` for orientation and the sizes that come with it, so a
rotation re-lays-out instead of rebuilding the activity. What this really saves is not the
navigation — it is **every unsaved edit**, which was being thrown away by turning the phone.

**Measured** on the device. It is also what made `FEAT-17` possible: an editor that survives a
rotation can ask for one.

**The standing obligation it creates:** handling a configuration change means Kestrel is now
responsible for anything that should change with it. Compose re-reads `LocalConfiguration` and the
editor re-measures from it, which covers what exists today; a future screen that depends on
configuration-specific resources has to be checked rather than assumed.

---

### `BUG-13` — The numbers dialog fits and scrolls — **closed `0.0.27-dev`**

Two fields to a row and a scrolling body. Four stacked fields in a dialog on a landscape phone put
width and height below the fold with no way to reach them — a feature that worked and could not be
used. **Measured** on the device.

---

### `BUG-14` — A minus sign without a minus key — **closed `0.0.27-dev`**

`± offsetX` and `± offsetY` flip the sign of whatever is in the field, including a half-typed one.
It does not depend on which keyboard someone has, which was the part that could not be relied on.
**Measured** on the device.

The underlying question — whether that keyboard offers a decimal point but no minus — is still not
answered, and no longer needs to be.

---

### `FEAT-13` — Three parts canvas to one part tools — **superseded `0.0.28-dev`**

Built in `0.0.27-dev`, confirmed working on the device, and replaced one round later by `FEAT-16`.

It is recorded rather than deleted because the lesson is worth keeping: three quarters of the screen
was better than half and still an answer to the wrong question. The canvas does not want *most* of
the screen — it is a picture of the screen, so it wants the screen. A permanent panel of any width
is that much of the picture missing.

What survived from it: `⋮ values` as a filled button among the others rather than a text button
nobody could see.

---

---

### `BUG-1` + `BUG-2` — The pad uses the notch, and the setting reaches it — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

Two entries, one fault, and it took the whole-screen decision to close them. The "use the notch
area" setting existed since `0.0.24-dev` and never reached the overlay: Kestrel's own screen obeyed
it and the pad — the only thing on screen while playing — did not.

Overlay windows now carry `FLAG_LAYOUT_IN_SCREEN` and `FLAG_LAYOUT_NO_LIMITS`, and a cutout mode of
`ALWAYS` on API 30 and above, `SHORT_EDGES` on 29. Without the first two the window manager keeps
every window inside the area it hands out, so a control the layout puts against the top of the
screen quietly arrives below the status bar.

**Measured** — the project owner confirmed the pad's top row sits in the notch strip.

**The cost, and it stands:** a control under the status bar shares that strip with the shade. A
swipe from the top edge will sometimes open the shade instead of pressing the control. The band
stays drawn on the editor's canvas so that is visible while arranging rather than discovered while
playing.

---

### `BUG-16` — Tools wrap instead of running off the edge — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

The control and window tools are `FlowRow`s. Seven buttons in a fixed row lost the last one off a
narrow panel, which is how `⋮ values` came to exist in portrait and not in landscape. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-11` — A grid, and snapping — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

Grid steps in the layout's own unit — 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.10 of the shorter side, labelled with the
pixels they come to on this phone. Two snapping modes, both off until asked for: to the grid, and to
the other controls' edges and centres and the screen's own. Edge snapping wins over the grid per
axis, because lining up with the control next door is a statement about this layout and landing on a
grid line is a statement about the screen.

A yellow **guide** appears while a control is being dragged, showing what it has caught, and goes
when the finger lifts. It had to be explained before it could be tested — which is a note about
this project's documentation, not about the feature.

**Measured** across three rounds. It shipped first in pixels, which was the wrong unit and was
caught by the project owner: a control is `0.12` and a grid line was `32px`.

---

### `FEAT-12` — Typing the numbers — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

A `⋮ values` button opens the four numbers — offsetX, offsetY, width, height — as fields on a
decimal keyboard, two to a row, in a body that scrolls. Apply validates through the same
`Placement.of` the file reader uses, so a bad number names the field and the range rather than being
silently clamped. `±` buttons flip the sign of an offset. The dialog states the units, which were
reported as confusing and are not obvious.

**Measured.** It took three rounds: the feature worked from the first, and was unusable in landscape
and unreachable in the tools until `BUG-13` and `BUG-16`.

---

### `FEAT-14` — The grid in the layout's own unit — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

Covered above with `FEAT-11`. Recorded separately because it was a separate correction: moving the
grid to fractions also meant a snapped control lands on a number the file can hold, which the pixel
grid could not promise on any screen.

---

### `FEAT-16` — The editor is the canvas — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

The canvas is the entire screen: no title above it, no margin around it, nothing beside it. Tools,
Save and Exit float in the middle — the one region a pad never occupies, because controls belong to
the corners a thumb reaches and the centre is what a game is played through. The tools open as a
sheet and close again; under the buttons, on a dark plate, the layout's name, whether anything is
unsaved, the selected control in both units, and any warning.

Leaving with unsaved changes asks first — added unasked, because "nothing is saved until it is
saved" makes an accidental exit expensive and the exit button had become very easy to press.

**Measured** — *"Yes, absolutely"* and *"working as expected"*.

---

### `FEAT-17` — The preview turns the phone — **closed `0.0.28-dev`**

The orientation buttons ask the activity to turn; the editor then measures the orientation it is
really in; leaving the editor puts the orientation back to the display setting.

What it removed is better than what it added: the old toggle drew a small picture of the phone
turned — a strip too narrow to work in — with system bars that were an estimate, since only the
orientation the phone is in can be measured. That estimate is gone from the code along with the
feature that needed it.

**Measured.** One round later the project owner asked for it to be a floating button rather than a
tool, which is `FEAT-18`.

---

---

### `CRIT-5` + `BUG-10` + `BUG-15` + `BUG-17` — The pad matches the editor — **closed `0.0.29-dev`**

*"now both are perfectly aligned"*, *"actually same size"*.

One thread, four entries, four rounds, and **three real causes stacked underneath one symptom**. It
is the most instructive thing in this file, so it is recorded as one item:

1. **The canvas was the wrong shape** (`CRIT-5`). It took the shape of whatever space the screen
   gave it — near-ultrawide — so controls appeared to overlap that did not.
2. **The canvas and the pad were on different surfaces** (`BUG-10`, then `BUG-15`). The canvas drew
   the display and the pad was laid out in the usable area. Settled by the project owner: the pad
   uses the whole screen, which also closed `BUG-1` and `BUG-2`.
3. **They were drawing at different sizes** (`BUG-17`). The overlay resolves
   `placement.scaledBy(controlScale)` — 0.85 by default — and the editor resolved `placement` alone.
   Every control on the canvas was about 17% larger than the pad draws it, and four controls that
   fit at 85% were reported as leaving the screen at 100%.

**The project owner found the third one, from a screenshot**, after this side had twice declared the
symptom fixed. Each fix was real and each report of success was wrong, because "it looks right now"
was accepted in place of "the two renderers agree".

**Do:** when two renderers must agree, diff the code paths rather than the pictures. `resolve`,
`shapedAs` and `scaledBy` are now the same three calls in both, and `DeviceSurface.forPad` is the
one answer to what they draw on.

**Do not:** report a match as fixed on the strength of one screenshot looking better.

Dragging writes the **unscaled** number to the file — the setting is applied on top of the document
and folding it in would shrink the layout a little further with every drag. There is a unit test for
neither of those, which is the next thing this thread needs.

---

### `FEAT-18` — Rotation is a fourth floating button — **closed `0.0.29-dev`**

`⟳` beside Tools, and the orientation section gone from the sheet. Turning the phone is done *while*
arranging, not configured beforehand. **Measured.**

---

---

### `BUG-18` + `BUG-20` — The canvas is the screen, with nothing drawn round it — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

The margin went first and the border a round later. Previewing the orientation the phone is in, the
canvas is now exactly 1 : 1 with the display and has nothing marking its edge, because the edge of
the screen is the edge of the screen. **Measured.**

---

### `BUG-19` + `BUG-21` — The home page scrolls to the edges — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

The title moved into the scroll, then the vertical padding went. Both were bands of a small screen
held permanently by things that had no reason to be fixed. Horizontal padding stays and does a real
job. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-19` — Long press a control — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

A menu at the control, with size, shape, copy and paste. **Copy takes size and outline only** —
position is never copied, because two controls in the same place are two controls one of which
cannot be pressed. Paste is offered **only within a family**: directional (the sticks and the pad),
buttons (face, shoulders, menu) and triggers, which the project owner separated out on the grounds
that a trigger is a long rectangle with a fill in it and nothing else on a pad is shaped like one.
When the clipboard holds the wrong family the menu says so, rather than showing a paste that refuses.

**Measured**, across two rounds — the first version opened partly off screen, which is `BUG-22`.

---

### `FEAT-20` — A shape is drawn as itself — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

`circle`, `square` and `rectangle` were three words that all meant "look at the picture you are
already looking at". They are the shapes now, drawn rather than taken from a font, from one place
used by both the tools and the menu. **Measured.**

**Where the rule stops:** `own window`, `snap to the grid` and the anchor names keep their words. A
label is not worse than an icon that has to be learned, and a project with no icon vocabulary should
not invent one a control at a time.

---

### `FEAT-21` — The same menu in window mode — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

Window options at the control, no copy and no paste. A group is a name shared between controls, so
copying one is joining it — which is what stepping through the list already does. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-22` — Material, and dark done properly — **closed `0.0.30-dev`**

Every screen, dialog, sheet and button follows one Material 3 colour scheme, and the pad keeps its
own palette because it is drawn over other applications and has to be legible on a white page and a
black one both. **Measured**, including that last part: *"theme doesn't change the gamepad and
canvas good."*

The version that shipped had the *shape* of the setting wrong — three themes in a row, where there
are really two questions: light or dark, and then how dark. `FEAT-23` corrects it. The colours
themselves were right first time.

**What it is not:** a redesign. The home page is still a developer's diagnostics screen, and that is
`CRIT-2`.

---

---

### `BUG-22` + `BUG-23` — The menu opens where it should, first time — **closed `0.0.31-dev`**

Measured rather than guessed, and laid out before being shown. **Measured** on the device — and one
round later the whole problem was removed rather than fixed: `FEAT-28` moves the menu to the centre,
where neither bug can happen. Both fixes were correct and both stopped mattering, which is what
happens when a design question is answered after the bugs it causes.

---

### `FEAT-23` — Two questions, not three answers — **closed `0.0.31-dev`**

**system, light, dark**, plus a **true black** switch live only when dark. The names an earlier build
wrote still read and `dark-amoled` still means true black, so upgrading does not throw away a
choice — unit-tested. Every binary setting is a switch. **Measured**, including the migration.

---

### `FEAT-24` — The sheet is settings — **closed `0.0.31-dev`**

Gear icon, smaller footprint, and only what is genuinely settings inside it: mode, grid, snapping,
the canvas, and a read-out of every window with its share of the screen. **Measured.**

**What made it possible:** the long-press menu became the complete per-control editor first. Taking
the tools out before the menu could replace them would have lost half the editor quietly.

---

### `FEAT-26` — Buttons are rounded rectangles — **closed `0.0.31-dev`**

Material 3 draws a filled button as a capsule and the theme cannot say otherwise — the token maps to
a full corner whatever `Shapes` holds — so the buttons are wrapped once and the application uses the
wrappers. One number decides the corner. Switches stay capsules. **Measured.**

---

---

### `FEAT-15` — One layout, two arrangements — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Each element keeps its six placement fields as the landscape arrangement and gains an optional
`portrait` object with the same six. Absent means "the same as landscape", which is what every layout
written before it means. **Measured**: portrait was given its own arrangement, edited, saved, and
landscape was untouched — in the file and in the pad.

**The schema version was not bumped, on purpose.** A build that does not know the field keeps it in
`unknownFields` and writes it back, so an older Kestrel preserves a portrait arrangement it cannot
use. Bumping would have made that file unreadable instead.

**Where the line was drawn wrongly, and corrected a round later.** Shape was put with identity —
kind, binding, group — on the grounds that what a control *is* does not change when the phone turns.
A shape is presentation, and presentation is exactly what an orientation is allowed to differ in.
`FEAT-31` moves it.

**And one half was missed entirely.** Dragging edited the orientation on screen; the values dialog
kept editing landscape. That is `BUG-29`, and it is the second time in this project a rule was
updated in one place and not its copy.

---

### `BUG-25` + `BUG-26` — The toggle clears the camera, and keeps clearing it — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Down by its own height in portrait, and repositioned whenever the phone turns rather than decided
once when the window was created. **Measured** in both orientations.

---

### `BUG-28` — The band caption is above the buttons — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Above them, and capped at 320dp so it is not a bar of text across the pad it describes. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-25` — Snapping survives a restart — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Grid size and both snapping switches are in `settings.json`. Built session-only first, on the
argument that working state does not belong in a preference file; the project owner asked for the
stronger thing and that settles it. **Measured** across a force-stop.

---

### `FEAT-28` — The menu opens in the middle — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Centred, with everything behind darkened except the control being edited, which stays lit — drawn by
the canvas rather than as a scrim, because only the canvas knows where the control is. Vertical in
landscape, wide in portrait. **Measured.**

**Half of it did not ship**, and the changelog said it had: the larger header and the icon close
button reached the window menu and never reached the control menu. That is `BUG-31`.

---

### `FEAT-29` — Real icons — **closed `0.0.32-dev`**

Google's Material icons through `material-icons-core` — Apache-2.0, from the Compose BOM already in
the build, `core` rather than `extended`. **Measured**, except the close button, which had not
actually been changed.

---

---

### `BUG-29` — Typing edits the orientation on screen — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

The values dialog read and wrote `placement` while everything else had moved to
`placementFor(portrait)`, so dragging in portrait moved the portrait arrangement and typing moved
the landscape one, from the same screen. **Measured** in both orientations.

**Second fault of this shape here**, after the editor and the overlay drawing at different sizes.
Both were one copy of a rule not updated with the other, and the project owner found both.

---

### `BUG-31` + `BUG-24` + `BUG-27` — The header and close button, actually shipped — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

A large bold accent title and a 56dp icon button. They had been written once, reached the window
menu, and never reached the control menu, because the edit meant to replace it matched nothing and
reported nothing. **Measured** this time.

**Do:** when an edit replaces existing text, check the old text is gone. A search-and-replace that
finds nothing is a silent failure, not a no-op.

---

### `FEAT-31` — A shape belongs to an orientation — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

An optional `shape` inside the `portrait` block. Kind, binding and group still cannot differ.
**Measured.** It corrected where `FEAT-15` drew the line between identity and presentation.

---

### `FEAT-32` — A way back for a stray control — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

A floating button that exists only while something is off the screen and restores **position only**
from the shipped layout. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-34` — The menu fits — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

One `values` button sharing a row with the anchor, steppers wrapped, nothing full-width without
reason. `copy` is reachable in both orientations. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-35` — The pad's settings live where the pad is — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

Size, dead zone, curve, sensitivity and both inversions in the editor's settings sheet. **Measured**
as present and saved — and they did nothing that could be felt, because the overlay was never told.
That is `BUG-34`, and it means this feature was reported working while half of it was not.

---

### `BUG-30` — The band says what it costs — **closed `0.0.33-dev`**

The caption names the consequence rather than the band. **Measured.**

**The diagnosis was wrong, though the fix was right.** The trouble is not being told; it is that a
control dragged into the band is hard to drag back out, because the touches to drag it with are the
touches the system takes. And the strip shaded in landscape was the camera cutout, which is not a
system window and is perfectly usable. Those are `BUG-33`, `FEAT-36` and `FEAT-37`.

---

---

### `BUG-33` — The cutout is not a band — **closed `0.0.34-dev`**

The band is the system bars alone. A cutout is a hole in the panel with no window over it, so a
control beside it works whether the phone is full screen or not. **Measured.**

---

### `FEAT-36` — The buttons are one block that moves and hides — **closed `0.0.34-dev`**

Dragged, long-pressed for Hide or Back to the middle, faded to a fifth and taking no touches while
hidden so the pad can be worked on through it. **Measured** — and it shipped with no clamping, so
it could be dragged off the screen, which is `BUG-35`.

---

---

### `CRIT-6` — 100% is what 80% was — **closed `0.0.35-dev`**

The pad came back the right size after the migration, the range behaved, and the project owner's
arrangement is the shipped default. **Measured.**

**And 200% was too much**, which the project owner said and the measurement agreed with — the
shipped layout is clean only to 1.03. That is `CRIT-8`.

---

### `CRIT-7` + `BUG-38` — The sizing proposal, and the anchor that moved — **closed `0.0.35-dev`**

Changing a control's anchor keeps its position now. **Measured.** The rest of the proposal was
assessed rather than built: its nine anchor points already existed, and its §2 and §4.1 contradict
each other — a layout stored in pixels moves or stretches on the next device, which is the failure
§4.1 exists to prevent. What survives as work is `FEAT-45` and `FEAT-46`.

---

### `BUG-34` + `BUG-37` — The stick shaping, felt and seen — **closed `0.0.35-dev`**

*"now it's feelable."* Two bugs and one symptom: the overlay was never told about a profile change,
and once it was, the knob still drew the raw finger while sending the shaped value. Both fixed;

### `FEAT-43`, `FEAT-44`, `BUG-32`, `BUG-35`, `BUG-36`, `FEAT-37` — **closed `0.0.35-dev`**

The anchor dot, the pad that dims and then goes, no shape where a shape does nothing, the block
clamped to the screen, the nine-part lines on the grid. All **measured** — with two remainders the
project owner found: four of the nine dots are invisible on a rounded screen (`BUG-40`) and the
block shared one position between orientations (`BUG-41`).

---

### `CRIT-8`, `BUG-39`, `BUG-40`, `BUG-41`, `FEAT-47`, `FEAT-48` — **closed `0.0.36-dev`**

The maximum that the shipped layout survives; the menu width that finally shipped; the inset anchor
dot; a block position per orientation; two idle timers; and windows drawn always instead of being a
mode. **All measured.**

Two of them came back with more work attached, and both are worth recording. The anchor dot was
still invisible at corners — inset was the wrong answer to a rounded screen, and `FEAT-49` replaces
the idea rather than adjusting it. And giving the block a position per orientation stopped it
dragging at all, which is `BUG-42`: a regression introduced by the fix beside it, in the same round.

---

---

### `CRIT-9`, `BUG-42`, `BUG-43`, `FEAT-50` — **closed `0.0.37-dev`**

`R3` moved and the ceiling reached 1.05 — after a correction, because the estimate given the round
before was 1.15 and the project owner decided on it. The block drags again. A control cannot be
dragged off the screen. The control menu moves like the block. **All measured.**

## Built, awaiting confirmation — `0.0.41-dev`

### `BUG-50` — The slider wrote a number Kestrel refused to read

`Float` cannot represent 1.2. The size slider rounded in `Float` and widened the result, so its own
maximum reached the file as `1.2000000476837158` — a hair over a ceiling of exactly 1.2. The reader
refused the field and, by its own correct rules, the whole document: every setting reverted to a
default and the folder, theme and chosen layout went with them.

Fixed three times over, because one place is not enough. The slider rounds in `Double` and clamps.
The reader treats a number outside a range by less than a millionth as the boundary — without which
**the file the project owner already has would still not load after the update**. And the writer
rounds the two scale fields, so no future path can leak float error into the file. The stick sliders
round the same way; none of their ends touch a bound, but the file now says what the label says.

Unit tested with the reported document verbatim. Unverified on a device.

---

### `BUG-51` — Three decimals, because two cannot hold the promise

`BUG-48` made the anchor arithmetic right and the control still moved. What was left was precision:
an offset is a fraction of the screen's shorter side stored to two decimals, which is 10.8 px on the
reference device. An anchor change expresses one point from a different origin, and two origins
quantise to two different grids — so the nearest storable value can be 5.4 px from where the control
is. Eight of those in a cycle made the hundredth the project owner measured.

Offsets and sizes now carry **three** decimals — 1.1 px. The readouts and the numbers dialog show
three too, since a dialog pre-filled with `0.26` for a stored `0.264` would move the control the
moment Apply was pressed. The offset range is scanned at the same precision, which was the reported
"off by 0.01".

Two tests: a full cycle through all eight anchors lands within 2 px at five sizes, and the same cycle
at two decimals does not — so the precision cannot quietly go back.

**Cost.** Layout files written from now on carry three-decimal offsets. Still hand-editable. The
shipped built-in is unchanged. Unverified on a device.

## Built, awaiting confirmation — `0.0.40-dev`

### `BUG-48` — Changing the anchor keeps the control still, at every size

An anchor says which edge a control keeps its distance from, not where it is, so changing one is a
change of description and the control must not move. That was implemented at full size — and a
centre is `origin(anchor) + offset × shortSide × scale`, so holding the *unscaled* centre still while
the origin moves leaves the *drawn* centre elsewhere. At 100% the two are the same number, which is
why it looked right until the size slider was used. At 115% a control crossed the screen.

The arithmetic is now `Placement.reAnchored(surface, anchor, scale)` in `:core` — scale, re-centre,
divide the scale back out, the same thing dragging does. It is the only copy and it has a test that
fails on the old version, at five sizes and every anchor.

**Not a regression from `0.0.39-dev`.** Nothing in that build touched the anchor; what changed was
the size being tested at. Unverified on a device.

---

### `BUG-47` — The numbers dialog checks the screen the pad is drawn on

The range `FEAT-56` prints, and the refusal it comes from, both resolved at 100% while the pad draws
at the size setting — so the dialog offered an offset and the pad then put the control off the edge.
Both apply the setting now, and the message says which size it is talking about.

Third time this shape of fault has been found: the document is the pad at full size and the setting
is applied on top of it, so anything reasoning about where a control *is* has to apply it too.
Unverified.

---

### `BUG-49` — Kestrel cannot write a layout it could not read back

A layout was reported corrupt after a save. **The cause is not established** — the file was deleted
before it could be read, and `BUG-48` throwing controls across the screen would produce a ruined
layout that parses perfectly well, which is the likelier story.

What was built is a guard: `LayoutRepository.save` writes the document to text, reads it back with
the same strict reader an imported file goes through, and refuses the write if it does not survive,
returning the reader's own typed error. That closes the parse-corruption family for every write path
— the editor, duplicate, and any import added later — and does nothing at all for a layout that is
merely arranged wrong. Unit tested. Unverified on a device.

---

### `FEAT-59` — A refused value scrolls into view

The dialog body scrolls and the message is the last thing in it, so on a landscape phone Apply
looked like a button that did nothing. The body scrolls to the message when one appears. Unverified.

---

## Built, awaiting confirmation — `0.0.39-dev`

### `BUG-46` — Save writes the orientation on screen

Since `FEAT-15` a layout holds two arrangements and the editor edits one at a time, but Save wrote
the whole document — so arranging landscape carefully and pressing Save committed whatever
half-moved state portrait was in.

Save now writes the orientation on screen and puts the other one back as it is in the file. The
other orientation's edits stay in memory, still unsaved, until the phone is turned to it.

Unsaved work is now **derived** from a comparison against what is in the file rather than set by a
flag. A dozen call sites edit the document; a flag would have to be set at every one of them, and
one missed call site means the editor lies about what is saved.

Three things are deliberately not held back: shared fields (header, bindings, the window a control
belongs to); a control with no portrait arrangement of its own, where editing upright *is* editing
landscape; and giving or dropping a portrait arrangement, which changes the shape of the document
rather than one view of it.

**Also fixed:** a failed save used to clear the unsaved marker anyway. `onSave` returns a typed
`SaveOutcome` now instead of a string the editor would have had to read the wording of.

Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-58` — Leaving names the arrangement that is still unsaved

The consequence of `BUG-46`: now that Save writes one orientation, Exit can lose work that is not on
screen. The dialog says which arrangement is pending, that Save writes only the one on screen, and
offers a **Go to landscape** / **Go to portrait** button that turns the phone to it. Unverified.

---

### `BUG-7` — One reading, one direction

The analog trigger showed its value twice on a circle: a fill rising from the bottom, and a border
sweeping clockwise. Two readings of the same number travelling different ways. The border now fills
bottom-to-top in the control's own shape, the same way the face does, for every shape.

The edge highlight was kept rather than removed, because the reason for it still holds: a fill inside
a small control is exactly the part a thumb is covering, and a trigger with only a face fill cannot
be read while it is pressed. Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-55` — The ceiling is 120%, and overlap is marked

`MAX_CONTROL_SCALE` drops from 1.50 to 1.20. The editor finds every pair of controls whose resolved
rectangles intersect — at the size the pad is actually drawn at, in the orientation on screen — and
outlines both in amber, with the count in the warning line. Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-56` — The off-screen refusal names the offsets it would accept

*"That puts the control off the screen"* is true and no help. It now names the allowed range for
each axis at the size that was typed and from the anchor that is set. The range is **scanned**
against the same `resolve` and `shapedAs` the drawing uses, not derived from a formula: a formula
that has to agree with that geometry is a second copy of it that will drift. It runs only after a
value has been refused, so eight hundred cheap probes cost nothing anybody can feel.

Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-57` — Four status lines are back

Warnings only when there are any; the layout's name with its orientation and whether it is saved;
what is selected; its size and position. Small face, so four lines cost about what one did.
Unverified.

---

## Confirmed and moved to closed items — `0.0.38-dev`

### `CRIT-10` — 50% to 150%, and what it costs

The range is in and the default layout is re-authored: every size at 0.90 of what it was, every
offset at 0.88 — measured rather than chosen.

**The promise is 50%–115%, not 50%–150%, and the arithmetic is why.** A layout guaranteed clean at
150% must be small enough at 100% that half again still fits, and controls anchored to opposite
edges move towards each other as the pad grows. Face buttons would have to be about 5 mm across. The
default is 6.3 mm and clean to 115%; above that the slider still goes and the editor marks what
meets.

**A test was checking the wrong thing.** `BuiltInLayoutsTest` validated the **landscape**
arrangement on portrait surfaces, which since `FEAT-15` is not what a portrait screen draws — so a
portrait arrangement could overlap itself and pass. The search that produced this default was wrong
until the pairing was fixed, and a test now checks the portrait arrangement on portrait screens.

Unverified on a device.

---

### `BUG-44` — Typed numbers obey the limits dragging obeys

Dragging clamped size and kept a control on screen; the dialog did neither, so a control 0.9 of the
screen wide and half of it off the edge could be typed in. **Two rules for one thing, and the one
nobody sees wins.** The dialog refuses both now, saying which. Unverified.

---

### `BUG-45` — Fading is a warning again

Hiding was counted from the last touch, so equal intervals made the second stage arrive with the
first. It is counted from the fade. Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-53` — The buttons minimise rather than fade

Fading solved the wrong problem, as the project owner said: a faded block is still catchable by a
thumb and still on top of what it covers. Minimised, it is one draggable button; tapping it brings
the block back to the middle. The block is opaque and says one line instead of five.

Unverified.

---

### `FEAT-49`, `FEAT-51`, `FEAT-52`, `FEAT-54` — carried and adjusted

The anchor region is lit and now snaps to the same grid the dividers do, a little stronger. Editor
sizes stop at 0.05 and 0.50. The idle settings are four. All unverified in their adjusted form.

---

## Before this list existed

The work below closed before `todo-list.md` and this file were created. It has no IDs because none
existed, and it is recorded descriptively so that nothing is rebuilt by accident.

### Phase 0 — input feasibility, and what it cost to find out

**Established, and it is the foundation everything else stands on:** a virtual input device created
through Shizuku's shell privilege delivers real controller input to ordinary target applications on
the reference device. `ADR-INPUT-001` is Accepted with that scope written into it. Evidence is in
`docs/phase0/results/`.

Two results are **binding on any implementation**, because they were measured rather than reasoned:

- **Persistence must be governed, not prevented.** A session is held by a lease that a privileged
  watchdog enforces, so force-stop and uninstall end it without Kestrel running any code. A backend
  that holds a device without one can strand a controller until the phone is rebooted — which
  happened once.
- **Identity keys on the device descriptor, never the numeric id**, which changes on every
  registration.

**`ADR-006` — the accessibility fallback — was measured and then rejected.** It worked: median 4 ms,
about 242 drag movements a second. It was rejected on product grounds, and the second reason is the
harder one: declaring an accessibility service made Play Protect block installation *for every
user*, confirmed in both directions. A failed experiment is a result and is written down as one.
Kestrel is Shizuku-only for input as a consequence.

### The overlay

A pad on screen, in windows the layout decides. What was learned building it:

- **A pointer belongs to the window that received its DOWN for the life of the gesture.** Sliding
  between controls only works inside one window. This is why grouping exists.
- **A view returning "not handled" does not pass the touch to the application below**, and irregular
  touchable regions are not public API. This is why windows are kept small.
- **Grouping by proximity does not work.** It was tried. On the shipped layout the gap that had to
  mean "together" and the gap that had to mean "apart" were fifteen pixels apart, so the answer
  flipped with rounding and with the size setting. Declared groups replaced it.
- **Anchors and edge margins, not absolute coordinates.** Coordinates computed against the display
  but placed by the window manager inside the usable area moved everything down when the status bar
  appeared, and the pad overlapped itself.
- **Windows are repositioned in place**, not destroyed and recreated, or resizing leaves trails.
- **Controller keys are consumed.** Observing them without handling them made the platform generate
  its own fallback keys, and `B` arrived twice — once as itself and once as Back.

### Layout as a document

`ControllerLayout` with a strict hand-written JSON reader and writer in `:core`. Placement is an
anchor plus inward offsets, sizes are fractions of the **shorter side** so a control keeps its shape
on any screen, and the writer emits **every editable field including nulls and defaults** — a file a
user is invited to edit should show them what there is to edit. Numbers are two decimals.

Built-ins are immutable and the editor duplicates rather than refusing. Storage re-validates the
chosen folder every few seconds and falls back to private storage with an explanation, after a
deleted folder was cached forever.

### Build and toolchain

Gradle with a version catalogue, three modules, CI on every push producing both APKs as artifacts,
lint failing the build. `:core` is Kotlin/JVM on purpose, which makes the architecture boundary a
compile error rather than a review comment.

### Rejected, and why

- **`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`** — measured Play Protect block. Storage access is SAF.
- **`ADR-006` accessibility fallback** — above.
- **Proximity-based grouping** — above.
- **Reverse portrait and sensor portrait** — reverse portrait does not work on the platform;
  sensor portrait is reported useless. `BUG-4` removes what remains.
