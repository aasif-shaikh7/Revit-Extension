## 1. What this repository currently is

**Kestrel** — an open-source Android 10+ gaming launcher and virtual-controller
environment. It aims to turn an ordinary phone into a handheld gaming device: one place to
launch emulators/streaming clients, configure a virtual gamepad, pick a layout and skin, and play.

**Current state: build foundation, plus a completed input feasibility experiment. No product
behaviour exists yet.**

Phase 0 passed on the reference device — a Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G on HyperOS 3.0.3, Android 15 —
and `ADR-INPUT-001` is Accepted, scoped to that device. The evidence is in `docs/phase0/results/`.
Nothing has been tested on any other hardware, latency has never been measured, and no fallback for
a user without Shizuku has been tested at all. Treat the mechanism as proven where it was measured
and as an assumption everywhere else.

What exists:

- A Gradle build: `settings.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, the wrapper, and
  `gradle/libs.versions.toml` as the single place versions are declared.
- Three modules. `:app` is the assembly layer — manifest, one activity, a placeholder screen,
  nothing else. `:core` is plain Kotlin/JVM and currently holds only `core/common/Outcome.kt`.
  `:tools:phase0` is the experimental feasibility harness.
- No `feature/`, `platform/`, or `data/` modules, no CI workflows, no input backend, no overlay, no
  session, no configuration implementation.

`:tools:phase0` is **not product code**. It is a measurement instrument with its own identifier and
its own APK, it depends on neither `:app` nor `:core`, and it deliberately injects nothing — it only
reports what Android delivers. Do not import from it, do not add it as a dependency, and do not
promote anything out of it without first moving it behind `platform/input/`
(`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` §27). Its procedure is `docs/phase0/README.md`.

`:core` is a Kotlin/JVM module rather than an Android library **on purpose**. It makes the boundary
in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` §21 a compile error rather than a review comment: Compose, Android UI, and
Shizuku cannot resolve there. Do not convert it to an Android module to make an import work — if a
domain type needs an Android API, it belongs in `platform/`.

What an agent can actually verify here:

```bash
./gradlew :core:test    # JVM only, no SDK needed — works in a bare container
./gradlew build         # everything: compiles both modules, lints, tests. Needs the SDK.
```

The whole build is known to pass with the SDK installed. In a container without one, `:core:test`
still runs but anything Android-side fails with `SDK location not found` — a missing prerequisite,
not a broken build. Say which of the two you actually observed, and never report an assembly as
passing when only `:core` ran. `docs/SETUP.md` documents the exact toolchain that works.

Stack, pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and confirmed mutually compatible by a real build:
Kotlin 2.2.21, Jetpack Compose (BOM 2026.05.01), AGP 8.13.2, Gradle 8.14.3, compileSdk 36,
min SDK 29 (Android 10, fixed by ADR-004), GPLv3. Lint runs as part of `build` and its errors fail
the build — fix them rather than suppressing, unless the suppression is genuinely justified and
commented. See `CHANGELOG.md` for what is verified and what is not.

## 2. Documentation map — who is authoritative for what

| File | Authoritative for |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Product overview, vision, status |
| `PRD.md` | Product requirements, scope, non-goals, development phases, MVP definition |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Layers, boundaries, domain model, input/Shizuku/session/display architecture |
| `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` | **Canonical** folder organization and dependency rules |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md` | Build/test workflow, testing levels, definition of done |
| `docs/SETUP.md` | Toolchain install and on-device run, without the full IDE |
| `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` | **Rules for AI-assisted implementation — read this before writing code** |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor workflow, coding style, commit/branch/PR conventions, governance |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy and threat boundaries |
| `docs/PHASE-0.md` | Input feasibility spec: tests, evidence grades, acceptance criteria |
| `docs/INPUT_BACKENDS.md` | Input abstraction and backend categories |
| `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md` | JSON configuration model, schema versioning, validation |
| `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` | Device/application compatibility matrix |
| `docs/DEGRADED_STATE.md` | What the user sees and can do when the preferred backend is unavailable |
| `docs/CONTROLLER_FAMILIES.md` | Xbox/PlayStation/Nintendo presentation, and where a family belongs |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture Decision Records — the *why* behind each choice |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Records decisions and artifacts actually established (not aspirations) |

Reading order before implementation work: `README.md` → `PRD.md` → `ARCHITECTURE.md` → relevant
module docs → relevant ADRs → `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` → `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md` → existing
code and tests.

### Hierarchy of truth

When sources conflict, higher wins:

```
Verified test result
  ↓ Android/project documentation
  ↓ Existing architecture
  ↓ PRD
  ↓ ADR
  ↓ Task description
  ↓ AI assumption
```

### Single-source rules

Several lists used to be duplicated across documents and had drifted. One owner each, now:

- **Folder placement** — `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` is canonical. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 reproduces the
  tree for context and says so; if they ever disagree, the canonical document wins and the other is
  corrected.
- **Which decision records exist** — the directory `docs/adr/` itself. Never cite a record from a
  list quoted in prose without checking the directory.
- **Status vocabularies** — three exist for different purposes and are not interchangeable:
  compatibility Status + Confidence (`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` §3–§4), Phase-0 evidence Grades A–E
  (`docs/PHASE-0.md` §28), and claim-verification states (`AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`). The mapping
  between them is `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` §4a. A Phase-0 grade never by itself sets a support status.

When a document conflicts with its owner, fix the copy and say so — do not silently change the owner.

## 3. Accepted architecture decisions

| ADR | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-001 | JSON is the canonical portable configuration format | Accepted |
| ADR-002 | Input is abstracted behind a backend interface | Accepted |
| ADR-003 | Shizuku is optional, never mandatory | Accepted |
| ADR-004 | Android 10 / API 29 baseline; phones only (no tablets/foldables) | Accepted |
| ADR-005 | GPLv3 for original project code | Accepted |
| ADR-006 | Touch fallback via an accessibility service and an overlay | **Rejected — measured, works, not worth shipping** |
| ADR-007 | One layout across capability tiers; unavailable controls are disabled, never removed or substituted | Accepted |
| ADR-INPUT-001 | Virtual input device with shell privilege, held by a lease, as the preferred backend | **Accepted — scoped to the reference device** |

Significant new decisions require a new ADR in `docs/adr/`. Naming (`CONTRIBUTING.md` §57):
sequential `ADR-NNN-topic.md`, numbers never reused or renumbered; a reserved prefix
(`ADR-INPUT-001.md`) only when a decision is gated on an experiment or scoped to one domain.
Superseded records stay in place with their status changed.

## 4. Architecture rules

### Layers

```
Presentation (Compose)  →  Feature/Application  →  Core/Domain (pure Kotlin)
                                                        ↑
                                              Platform (Android-specific)
```

### Where code goes

- Pure domain logic → `core/` (`common`, `model`, `configuration`, `input`, `layout`, `profile`,
  `skin`, `compatibility`, `diagnostics`)
- User-facing features → `feature/` (`launcher`, `gaming-session`, `controller-editor`, `skins`,
  `settings`, `community`)
- Android-specific implementations → `platform/` (`android`, `display`, `foreground-app`, `overlay`,
  `shizuku`, `input/{gamepad,shizuku,fallback}`)
- Packaged configuration, built-ins, schemas, migrations → `data/`
- Developer utilities → `tools/`
- Shared test fixtures → `tests/`; module-specific unit tests stay with their module
- Research and evidence → `docs/`

### Dependency rules

Allowed: `feature → core`, `feature → platform abstractions`, `platform → core`,
`app → feature/platform/core`.

**Never:** `core → Compose`, `core → Android UI`, `core → Shizuku`, `core → a specific input
implementation`. A Composable must never call Shizuku or an injection API directly — it goes
UI → InputEngine → InputBackend → platform implementation.

Do not create a new top-level directory because nothing seems to fit. Classify the file first
(Domain / Feature / Platform / Data / Tool / Documentation / Test); if the architecture genuinely
lacks a category, propose an architecture change instead.

Gradle module count should stay small initially. Package/domain boundaries are mandatory even when
modules are physically grouped.

---

## 5. Subsystem rules that are easy to get wrong

### Input (highest-risk subsystem)

- Domain and UI code use **controller semantics** (`GamepadButton.A`, `LEFT_X = 0.73`), never Android
  key codes.
- Sticks normalize to `-1.0…+1.0`; triggers to `0.0…+1.0`. Dead zone, sensitivity, inversion, and
  curves belong to the transformation layer, not to individual backends — and must be pure,
  unit-testable Kotlin.
- Backend selection is **capability-driven**, not name-driven.
- Every backend must release active buttons, reset axes, stop privileged services, and clean up on
  session end or failure. A backend that can leave stuck input is not production-ready.
- Do not call anything a "true virtual gamepad" unless device testing proves target applications
  receive controller-style input. Distinguish touch simulation, key-event injection, motion/axis
  injection, and virtual HID identity — they are different capabilities.
- High-frequency analog updates must not drive global Compose recomposition.

### Shizuku

- `Shizuku installed ≠ Shizuku running ≠ permission granted ≠ capability available`, and
  **Shizuku ≠ root**. Privilege levels are `NONE`, `ADB_SHELL`, `ROOT`, `UNKNOWN`.
- Detect actual capabilities; never infer them from installation state.
- Keep Shizuku behind a narrow capability interface. Do not scatter Shizuku calls through features.
- Never put normal application lifecycle/UI code inside the Shizuku UserService.

### Configuration / JSON

- Every configuration document carries `schemaVersion`, `type`, `id`, `name`.
- Stable IDs (`builtin.xbox.default`, `user.<uuid>`) are distinct from display names; renaming must
  not change an ID.
- Built-ins are **immutable**. The workflow is Built-in → Duplicate → User copy → Edit, and
  immutability must be enforced in the repository/domain layer, not by hiding an edit button.
- Validate every import (schema version, required fields, types, ID format, ranges, enums,
  collection sizes, references, file limits). Invalid data returns a typed error and must not crash.
- Preserve unknown non-executable fields where safe.
- Configuration is **data**. Never add fields that execute shell commands, code, native libraries,
  or downloaded plugins. Community content stays declarative and non-executable.
- Schema changes need versioning, migration where appropriate, tests, and documentation updates.

### Display

Never claim an external game was resized because Kestrel changed its own layout. Cross-app activity
embedding is Android 13+ with trust/opt-in restrictions and must not be a dependency of the
Android 10+ architecture.

### Security

Do not generate code that executes downloaded configuration, runs arbitrary community commands,
silently escalates privileges, collects credentials, adds hidden telemetry, or bypasses security
checks. Structured logs must exclude personal data, credentials, tokens, and screen content.
See `SECURITY.md`.

## 6. Development phases (gating)

`Phase 0 (input feasibility)` → `1 Core app` → `2 Controller engine` → `3 Layout editor` →
`4 Gaming session` → `5 Shizuku` → `6 Skins` → `7 Community system`.

**Phase 0 passed on one device, and `ADR-INPUT-001` is Accepted with that scope written into it.**
What that licenses is building Phase 1 on the named mechanism. What it does not license is treating
any other device, any latency figure, or any fallback path as settled — those need their own
evidence, and `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` records them as Untested until they have it.

Phase-0 prototypes stay under `tools/phase0/` and remain experimental. The harness is a measuring
instrument, not the backend: an implementation must be rebuilt behind `platform/input/`
(`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` §27) rather than promoted from there.

Two results from Phase 0 are binding on any implementation, because they were measured rather than
reasoned. **Persistence must be governed, not prevented** — a session is held by a lease that a
privileged watchdog enforces, so force-stop and uninstall end it without the application running any
code; a backend that holds a device without one can strand a controller until the user reboots. And
**identity keys on the device descriptor, never the numeric id**, which changes on every
registration.

---

## 7. Working conventions

**Branches:** `feature/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `test/…`, `experiment/…` (e.g.
`feature/shizuku-capability-check`, `fix/layout-import-validation`). Avoid substantial work directly
on the default branch.

**Commits:** clear, focused, imperative-ish subjects — `Add layout schema validation`,
`Fix analog stick normalization`. Not `fix stuff`. Keep unrelated changes in separate commits.

**Kotlin style:** clear names, focused functions, immutable data where practical, interfaces at
meaningful boundaries, no giant classes, no global mutable state, no Android specifics in domain
code, no new architectural pattern without a requirement. Simplest design that satisfies the
requirement wins.

**Tests are part of implementation.** Unit tests for JSON/schema/layout geometry/profile
matching/analog processing/capability selection; instrumentation tests for lifecycle, services,
overlays, discovery, persistence; **device tests** for input backends, Shizuku, overlays, OEM
behavior, target-app compatibility, and performance. Desktop compilation proves none of the Android
behavior.

**Dependencies:** before adding one, state why it is needed, why platform/existing code is
insufficient, its license, Android compatibility, maintenance risk, and build impact. Update
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.

**Documentation upkeep:** device-specific results go to `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` with device, Android
version, firmware, Kestrel version/commit, target app, backend, result, and limitations. JSON
changes update `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md`. Architecture changes update `ARCHITECTURE.md` and add
an ADR. `CHANGELOG.md` records only what has actually been established.

**Definition of done:** required behavior exists, relevant tests pass, Android-specific behavior was
tested where necessary, architecture boundaries preserved, docs updated, limitations documented, no
debug code or secrets remaining.

## 8. Rules specific to AI agents

These come from `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` §34, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` §54–55.

- **Never fabricate an API.** Do not invent Android, Compose, Shizuku, Gradle, permission, or hidden
  APIs. If an API cannot be verified, propose a small experiment instead of guessing.
- **Never fake results.** "Should work" is not "tested." Use explicit states: `Unverified`,
  `Experimental`, `Tested`, `Supported`. Never invent test output or device results.
- **Inspect before editing.** Read existing interfaces, call sites, tests, and implementations first.
- **Smallest reasonable change.** No giant rewrites, no unrelated reformatting, no new database, no
  silent architecture replacement.
- **Report Android specifics** for platform claims: API level, permissions, lifecycle constraints,
  OEM risk, public vs hidden API status, Shizuku/root requirement, fallback behavior.
- **Say when uncertain.** The agent is expected to challenge impossible requirements and stop for a
  feasibility experiment when a fundamental assumption is unproven.

### Task format worth requesting or restating

```
Goal / Context / Relevant files / Requirements / Constraints /
Do not change / Tests / Acceptance criteria
```

### End-of-task report

```
Implemented:
Files changed:
Tests added:
Tests run:
Device tests:
Known limitations:
```

State plainly when something could not be run — in this repository, "Tests run: none, no build
system exists yet" is the correct and honest answer.

### Standing reporting convention

Requested by the project owner, and binding on every reply rather than on milestones.

- **Say where the roadmap stands.** Every reply ends with the current position in the phase list of
  §6, what moved this time, and what is next. A reader should never have to ask "so where are we".
- **`CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root is the record**, and it is updated in the same commit as
  the work it describes — never afterwards, never in a batch. It carries what was *established*,
  including what was established to be false.
- **Report outcomes by kind, and separately.** A reply distinguishes:
  - **Success** — what now works, and what evidence says so.
  - **Failure** — what did not work, including a failure of the agent's own making. A failed
    experiment is a result and is written down as one.
  - **Warning** — something that works but carries a cost, a limit, or an assumption not yet tested.
  - **Do / Do not** — what follows for anyone working here next, when the work produced a rule.
- **Never let a good outcome bury a caveat.** If something works on one device, in one firmware,
  once, the reply says so in the same breath as the result.

## 9. Principle

> Use AI to increase development speed, not to reduce engineering discipline.

The project owner remains responsible for product decisions, review, physical-device testing, and
release readiness.
